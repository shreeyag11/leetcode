// There are 2N people a company is planning to interview. The cost of flying the i-th person to city A is costs[i][0], and the cost of flying the i-th person to city B is costs[i][1].

// Return the minimum cost to fly every person to a city such that exactly N people arrive in each city.

 

// Example 1:

// Input: [[10,20],[30,200],[400,50],[30,20]]
// Output: 110
// Explanation: 
// The first person goes to city A for a cost of 10.
// The second person goes to city A for a cost of 30.
// The third person goes to city B for a cost of 50.
// The fourth person goes to city B for a cost of 20.

// The total minimum cost is 10 + 30 + 50 + 20 = 110 to have half the people interviewing in each city.
 

// Note:

// 1 <= costs.length <= 100
// It is guaranteed that costs.length is even.
// 1 <= costs[i][0], costs[i][1] <= 1000
